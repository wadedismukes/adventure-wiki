## Humans

Humans are similar to how they are on our own Earth. There are numerous ethnicities and cultural groups. Unlike in our world these ethnicities are found throughout human lands, a result of the various empires trading and moving peoples around. They are otherwise similar to how they are in the PHB. Here is a work-in-progress list of the cultural areas in the Thalimor Sea region: 

* Kingdom of Angonia - ruled by Queen Heroudis. This Kingdom's capital is Bellefort a vast fortress city on the southern coast of the Thalimor Sea. This is a predominantly agrarian society,they trade often with the Dwarfs of the Ashen Peaks and the Brewbeard Hills. Long ago the Dwarfs helped the humans in this region construct a road running along the coast, the Wulfway, and the marvelous city of Dunwulf. Dunwulf operates more or less as a city-state of its own but is culturally within this human Kingdom.

		- Female: Alice, Matilda, Agnes, Margaret, Joan, Isabella, Emma, Beatrice, Mabel, Cecilia
		- Surnames based on towns the people are from or professions. Many do not have surnames.

* Hurstlandian League - west of Angonia is a league of mercantile city-states with a common human culture. These cities surround the straight of Gorham on the western end of the Thalimor Sea where it empties into the Great Sea. Their capital is Hursthaven which controls trade on the Western side of the Thalimor Sea. They are led by the head of numerous merchant guilds: the Mercers, the Spicers, the Goldsmiths, the Drapers, and the Fishmongers being the most prominent and powerful guilds. 
	 
	* Example Names:
		- Male: Berhart, Clas, Gaspar, Engelbert, Jorg, Murtin
		- Female: Elsebet, Dorothea, Cecilia, Clara, Eva, Katerina
		- Surnames work similar to Angonia. Could reflect their connection to one of the merchant guilds. 

There are numerous human cultures in this world speaking different languages. "Common" is the trade langauge of the Thalimor Sea it is actually the language spoken by the previous Wevendran Magocracy mixed with numerous groups including humans from around the Thalimor Sea. Humans from specific regions know regional languages. For example, a human from the Kingdom of Angonia will know Angonian.
