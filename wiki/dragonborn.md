## Dragonborn

Dragonborn were created by the evil chromatic dragons to fight against orcs and dwarves and their allies in the Dragon Wars. Some of the metallic dragons also created dragonborn to fight against the chromatic dragons. 


### Magic

Dragonborn have an inherent love of magic being themselves magical creatures. They were among the wizards of the Wevendra Magocracy and many were highly talented in many schools of magic. Unlike humans and halflings, they do not distrust magic and do not blame it for the War of the Feycerrag. They believe this was the hubris of the Magocracy itself and the greed from the Evil Three that caused this.

 
### Religion

Unlike humans, orcs, gnomes, and halflings, dragonborn were not the product of the Good Three. They were indirectly created by the Evil Three, and thus have a different relationship with the gods than many. Evil dragonborn will worship the Evil Three fervently, but good dragonborn are likely to practice a form of ancestor worship where they revere the metallic dragons who chose to be good creatures. Through these ancestors they are granted divine gifts they believe because without them they would still be enslaved by their creators. 


### Appearance 

Dragonborn look like wingless,bipedal dragons—scaly,bright-eyed, and thick-boned, with horns on their heads. Dragonborn of chromatic ancestry have scales that are black, blue, green, red, or white, whereas dragonborn of metallic ancestry have scales that are the color of brass, bronze, copper, gold, or silver. When two dragonborn whose scales are of different colors produce a child, their offspring’s scales match those of one parent or the other. Like their draconic ancestors, dragonborn can exhale acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. One can tell the type of energy a dragonborn breathes by the color of the dragonborn’s scales.
