# Elemental Planes

The elemental planes formed out of the Outlands from the battles between Auriel and Tharizdun. Their strategizing led to the creation of Primus, their spilled blood swirled endlessly created Ultimus. The former created Mechanus and the latter Limbo. After Ultimus' creation and subsequent departure, the Outlands shattered into a chaotic blend of the four primal elements of earth, water, wind and fire. Overtime this chaos settled and each element coalesced into its own plane.  

## The Plane of Fire

The Plane of Fire is one of constant heat from a red-hot sun that never fully sets. Thick ash blows from massive volcanoes and lava floes pockmark the surface.The majority of the plane is made up of the Cinder Wastes, a massive plain of black cinders and embers crossed by lava rivers. The Plane of Fire is home to one of the few true cities in the Elemental Planes, the City of Brass. This is the home to the efreet and many of their allies. 


## The Plane of Water

The Plane of Water is an endless sea dotted with atolls and islands rising from massive coral reefs. The storms here can cause portals to open to the Material Plane trapping numerous ships. Here marids and merfolks like out their lives under the waves. 

## The Plane of Wind

An open expanse with constant winds of varying strength. Here and there chunks of earth drift in the openness --- the remnants of failed invasions by denizens of  the Plane of Earth. THese earth motes serve as homes for the creatures of elemental air, and mant motes are covered with lush vegetation. Other creatures live on cloud banks infused with enough magic to become solid surfaces, strong enough to support towns and castles. 

## The Plane of Earth

The Plane of Earth is an endless mountain range rising higher than any in the material plane. It has no sun of its own, and no air surrounds the peak. The denizens of this plane live deep within the caves and caverns within this mountain range.
