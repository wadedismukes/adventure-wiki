## Creation of Astraeus

Once upon a time, there was a world that began as a struggle between light and dark. At the beginning of time, the forces of light and dark clashed in a great battle that lasted for eons. As the battle raged on, the forces of light emerged victorious, but not without a cost. The energy released during the struggle created three separate worlds.

The first world was a realm of pure light, where the sun always shone, and the stars and moon lit up the sky. This world was known as the Faerie Realm and was home to all manner of magical creatures, such as elves, gnomes, goblins, and sprites. The Faerie Realm was a place of eternal summer, and the creatures who lived there knew nothing of the hardships of the mortal world.

The second world was a realm of complete darkness, known as the Shadow Realm. It was a place of lost spirits and dead things, where nothing could thrive. It was said that the Shadow Realm was a place where souls went to be lost forever, and where dark creatures roamed freely.

The third world was a realm that lay between the two extremes, a world much like our own, but infused with magic and wonder. This was the world where humans, dwarfs, and dragonkin lived. It was a place where the forces of light and darkness mingled, and where good and evil were in constant conflict.

In this world, humans built great cities, and the dwarfs mined deep into the earth. The dragonkin ruled the skies, and the forces of light and darkness were constantly at war. It was a world of great danger, but also of great beauty and wonder.

Over time, the three worlds grew apart, and the beings that lived in them forgot about their origins. The Faerie Realm remained a place of eternal summer, the Shadow Realm a place of eternal darkness, and the mortal world a place of endless conflict. However, some remembered the ancient struggle, and they knew that one day, the forces of light and darkness would clash again, and the fate of all three worlds would be decided.
