Motsognir comes in May, when the earth is being worked and crafted into useful things. Olia follows in June, as the creativity and beauty of the natural world are on full display. Zio comes in July, as the crops are growing and the people are beginning to think about protecting what they have created. Bestra follows in August, as the harvest is approaching and the people come together to share and celebrate. Donar comes in September, when the storms of autumn are starting to pick up and contests of skill and revelry are in full swing. Ingwaz comes in October, as the magical energies of the world are at their height. Titania follows in November, as the beauty of the forests and the trickery of the elves are at their peak. Stohelit comes in December, when the natural world is dying and winter is taking hold. Mab follows in January, as the hunting season is at its peak and the goblins are on the move. Finally, Thalassa comes in February, when the weather is wet and wild and the sea is at its most powerful
