## Dragons

Dragons were created by the Evil Three as a weapon to cause strife on the Material Plane. Some turned against their own kind during the Wars against the Dragons and these were blessed by the Good Three as representatives of good will. These blessings turned their scales metallic creating the first metallic dragons.

The remainder of the dragons vary in their qualities showing aspects of the Evil Three. The black dragons received the cruelty of Loviatar. Blue Dragons received their love for manipulation from Asmodeus. Green Dragons received a love of lies and secrets from Asmodeus. White dragons received their hunger from Lolth. And it is said that Tharizdun himself had a hand in creating the great Red Dragons. Fully respresenting the greed and vanity that is the root of all evil.

The metallic dragons were transformed from these flipping these ideals entirely:
* red -> gold
* white -> silver
* black -> copper
* blue -> brass
* green -> bronze

The dragons created their own minions in the dragonborn, wyverns, kobolds, and lizardfolk to soldier their armies.
