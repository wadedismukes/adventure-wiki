## Hurstland


The Hurstlandian League is a loose confederation of city-states and small kingdoms located in the eastern part of the continent. It was formed in response to a common threat from a neighboring kingdom that was attempting to conquer and absorb their territories. The Hurstlandian League was initially formed as a military alliance to defend against this external threat.

Over time, the Hurstlandian League has grown and become more organized, developing a shared system of trade, governance, and defense. Each member state retains its own autonomy and sovereignty, but they work together on matters of common interest, such as trade regulations and border disputes.

The League is led by a council of representatives from each member state, and decisions are made by consensus. The council also appoints a military commander who oversees the League's combined military forces, which are made up of soldiers from each member state.

The Hurstlandian League is known for its strong military traditions and skilled warriors, as well as its prosperous trade routes that connect the various member states. However, it is also known for its fractious internal politics, with rivalries and power struggles between member states sometimes causing instability and conflict within the League.

Despite these challenges, the Hurstlandian League remains a powerful and influential force in the region, with a strong sense of shared identity and purpose among its member states.
