## Religion of the Good Three

The peoples of the Thalimor Sea region follow the Church of the Good Three. These are the primary forces of Good; however, just as in the real world evil and neutral people can take advantage of relgion just as they can any other political force. The difference being these people could be covertly working for the Evil Three (who really need a better name). 

### Creation

While the people of this would recognize Auriel as the ultimate creator, they are seen as ineffable and so they recognize the creators of their world (see [here](inner-planes.md)) as their gods and protectors. 

### Afterlife

Based on the life you lived you will go to a particular [Upper Plane](upper-planes.md). If you are particularly just and defended the weak you will go to live on the slopes of Mount Celestia. If you were humble and kind you will go the fields of Elysium. If you used your creative gifts to increase the beauty of the would you will go to Arborea.  

### Ideals 

Zio's Ideals:

* Uphold justice and fairness for all.
* Protect the weak and vulnerable.
* Always speak the truth and act with honesty.
* Use your strength to defend what is right.
* Be loyal to those who have earned your trust.

Olia's Ideals:

* Use your creativity to bring beauty and wonder into the world.
* Take pride in your craftsmanship and strive for excellence in all you do.
* Honor the gifts of nature and use them wisely.
* Use your talents to benefit others and enrich their lives.
* Seek out new experiences and opportunities to learn and grow.

Havra's Ideals:

* Strive for inner peace and tranquility.
* Respect and protect the natural world.
* Cultivate humility and compassion in all your interactions.
* Value community and work for the greater good.
* Foster a sense of gratitude and appreciation for the gifts of life.

Clerics typically choose one of the Good Three's examples to follow seeing all three as equally valid. Few follow all fifteen ideals as this is seen as both impractical and antithetical to the idea that the Good Three represent three pathways to be Good. 


### Rituals

To become part of the Church hierarchy an oath must be spoken in the presence of symbols for each of the three and a priest:

"I, [name], swear before the Good Three, to uphold their teachings and to live my life in accordance with their principles of justice, creativity, and humility. I vow to devote myself to the service of the Good Three and to use my skills and abilities to benefit the community and promote their values. I pledge to conduct myself with honesty, integrity, and compassion, and to be a worthy representative of the Good Three in all my actions. So mote it be."

Many may take this oath including paladins, monks, and clerics, but the church may employ really any of the character classes themselves. 

### Icons

Each of the Good Three and their progeny are represented using symbols. The following is a list until I decide to do art:

* Zio - a sheathed sword
* Havra - a bouquet of apple blossoms
* Olia - a chisel 

These are combined with the sheathed sword facing down and the bouquet of apple blossoms behindon the left and the chisel behind on the right.

Their progeny also have symbols:

* Bojar - a potato on a green background
* Donar - a hammer with a lightning bolt embossed in it 
* Ingwaz - a triple spiral
* Oghma - an eye in a pentagram
* Titania - a white diamond with a blue star
* Mab - a black diamond representing the theft of the Feycerrag 

### Organization


The Church of the Good Three is led by a single High Priest or Priestess elected by the three Archpriests or Archpriestesses. The High Priest is responsible for overseeing the religious practices and teachings of the church and decided on doctrinal changes. They also consult with agents of the Good Three sent from the Upper Planes. 

Under the High Priest are the Archpriests. There is one Archpriest elected by the Senior Priests based on how well they are believed to embody aspects of a particular member of the Good Three. For example, a Senior Priest who all believe to be particularly humble may be elected as the representative of Havra. Archpriests manage the church finances and which Senior Priests receive funds. They also appoint Senior Priests and organize large-scale charitable activities. The Archpriests also manage the funds that go to monastic and chivalric orders for their maintenance outside of donations. Those organizations are otherwise autonomous, but do answer ultimately to the High Priest and the Archpriests. 

The Senior Priests oversee large areas such as a small kingdom or a city-state. Senior Priests appoint Deacons who are assigned to townships and cities. Senior priests conduct worship in capital cities and major population centers and organize meetings of the Senior Priests to elect new Archpriests. They also manage the funds provided to them by the Archpriests to feed the poor, help the sick, build new churches, etc. 

Deacons are the priests of small cities and towns. They conduct most religious services: regular worship, perform religious rites and ceremonies, and healing for townspeople if necessary. 

Acolytes are young folks training to become part of the clergy of the Church of the Good Three. They assist in worship services and learn about the teachings of the Good Three. Some acolytes live in large religious compounds, while others may live in a small town church or near the town's shrine. 

### Factions

The largest faction is the church itself which functions as a large political organization.

#### The Order of the Threefold Path

* This order of monks is dedicated to following the three virtues embodied by the Good Three: justice, creativity, and humility.
* Members engage in a rigorous regimen of meditation, prayer, and physical training to develop their minds, bodies, and spirits.
* The order emphasizes service to others, and members often work as healers, protectors, educators, or social workers in the surrounding communities.
* The order is led by a Master of the Threefold Path who is considered the ultimate authority on matters of spiritual practice and discipline.

#### The Tribunal

* This is the judicial arm of the Church of the Good Three, they also act in intelligence gathering and advising to kingdoms and city-states
* They are currently trying to enact laws to control the use of magic around the Thalimor Sea region
* They believe arcane magic is dangerous and cite the results of the War of the Feycerrag as evidence
