## Gnomes

Gnomes are pretty much the exact same as they are described in the PHB. They're inquisitve, love life, love good jokes. They live in wooded hills typically. They were the first to harness magic as wizards.

### Magic

Magic is central to gnomish life, and has allowed them to survive the calamities. They are renowned illusionists, able to hide themselves and their communities from those who would threaten them. With the humans, they established the first wizarding school of the material plane.

### Religion

Gnomes worship the Good Three as many mortal races do, and they revere Olia above the others as the dwarfs do but not to the same extent.
