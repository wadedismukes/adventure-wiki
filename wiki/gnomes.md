## Gnomes

Gnomes are pretty much the exact same as they are described in the PHB. They're inquisitve, love life, love good jokes. They live in wooded hills typically. They were the first to harness magic as wizards.

Gnome society is largely organized around their affinity for magic and machinery. They have established guilds and workshops for various trades, from alchemy to clockwork engineering. Gnome wizards are highly respected, and often take on leadership roles within their communities.

While gnomes worship the Good Three, they also have a strong connection to the elemental forces of the world. Many gnomes specialize in elemental magic, harnessing the power of earth, air, fire, and water to fuel their inventions and spells.

Despite their lighthearted nature, gnomes have faced many challenges throughout their history. They have survived wars, natural disasters, and even invasions by other races seeking to exploit their technological advancements. As a result, gnomes have developed a strong sense of resilience and resourcefulness, always finding a way to overcome adversity.

Overall, gnomes are a complex and fascinating race with a deep connection to magic and technology. Their society is built on a foundation of creativity, ingenuity, and a boundless curiosity about the world around them.

### Magic

Magic is central to gnomish life, and has allowed them to survive the calamities. They are renowned illusionists, able to hide themselves and their communities from those who would threaten them. With the humans, they established the first wizarding school of the material plane.

### Religion

Gnomes worship the Good Three as many mortal races do, and they revere Olia above the others as the dwarfs do but not to the same extent.
