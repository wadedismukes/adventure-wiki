## Orcs

Orcs were a proud tradition-bound people who valued honor and combat. They were the primary force that fought against the dragons in the Wars of the Dragons; however, they remained neutral during the Feycerrag War. They are an honor culture who believe dying in battle is the most honorable way to die. Across the Thalimor Sea there is the Orcish Gowron Empire that trades widely across the sea. Outside of the Gowron Empire, orcs are found in all walks of life but they often work as mercenaries. Sometimes these orcs get tempted by evil and decide to become bandits or criminals of some kind. Some Orcs also believe that Orc society was at its best when they were a nomadic people riding the noble Axebeak into battle and on hunts, and so they live in isolated communities outside of Orcish civilization.

### Religion

Orcs revere the Good Three. In particular, they revere Zio above the others, but as they have farmers and craftsman as well all three are honored at temples and shrines. They also have many stories of great heroes that form a sort of mythology over the religion of the Good Three. Tradition and ritual are highly important to orcs.

### Magic

Most orcs don't like magic, but they do respect it. They are somewhat less likely than the average species to take up magic as a profession.
