# Feycerrag Gems

## Origin

The Feycerrag were gems that held the light of the three Upper Planes of Arborea, Elysium, and Celestia. The Fey epic poem Creadigaethau Rhiannon speaks directly of their creation. It brief, it states that one of the first elves' created by the suffusing of magic with the creatures of prehistoric Astraeus was the elf Rhiannon. Rhiannon more than any elf since had the creativity of Olia deep in her soul. She along with a number of the first elves were taken to enjoy the realms of the Heavens, and while there Rhiannon learned many crafts from Olia herself. Using her newfound knowledge, Rhiannon crafted three stones one for each of the Heavens and each contained the essence of their magic in purest form. No object or creature could ever match their beauty in the world of Fey or Mortals. Upon returning to the Feywild, Rhiannon gifted these three gems to her creators: Titania and Mab. They each placed one gem in their crowns, and the third was kept by Rhiannon. 

## Current Whereabouts

After the destruction of the Wevendra Magocracy and the subsequent war between the Fey and the mortal kingdoms, the Feycerrag gems (sometimes shortened simply to Feycerrag) were lost for many years. Some say that they were scattered across the planes, lost forever. Others say that they were taken by powerful beings and hidden away for safekeeping.

However, rumors persist that the Feycerrag gems have recently resurfaced in the hands of a group of powerful wizards who seek to harness their power for their own purposes. Some fear that this could reignite the conflict between mortals and the Fey, as the Fey may see this as a threat to their sovereignty.

Others believe that the Feycerrag gems should be returned to their rightful owners, the Fey, as a gesture of goodwill and peace. However, this is a controversial issue, with many mortals arguing that the gems were stolen fair and square, and that they should be kept as a symbol of their triumph over the Fey. Other rumors suggest the dragons have stolen them through plots and schemes in an attempt to steal their magic.

The fate of the Feycerrag gems remains uncertain, but their potential power and significance means that they will likely continue to be a source of tension and conflict between mortals and the Fey for years to come.

Editors note: The Fey discuss the dichotomy between Mortals and Fey. In reality, most sages beieve Fey to be Mortals themselves. Evidence from the Chronicles of the War of the Feycerrag suggest this. That is, Fey do seem to bleed and die quite similarly to the Mortal races. Indeed, the dwarf sage Adrek compares the average lifespans of the Fey races with those of the mortal races in his treatise "On the Lifespans of Creatues Mortal and Fey" and deduces that many mortal races can live just as long as the Fey further muddying the waters of difference between the two.
