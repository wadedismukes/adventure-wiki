## Angonia

The Kingdom of Angonian was founded after the fall of the Wevendra Magocracy, when several human and gnome settlements came together with the Dwarfs of the Ashenpeaks to form a new, united kingdom. The capital city of Bellefort was built on the ruins of an old Magocracy city.

The kingdom is ruled by a monarchy, with the current Queen, Queen Heroudis being a descendant of the original founders. The royal family is known for its just and benevolent rule, and the king has several trusted advisors who help her govern the realm. Her advisors are members of gnome, human and dwarf communities. The queen is seen as the head power in the region, but there are many smaller kingdoms within Angonia that are allowed to rule themselves. 

The kingdom is primarily agricultural, with farmers growing wheat, barley, oats, and other grains, as well as raising sheep and cattle. There are several large cities and towns, but most of the population lives in small villages or on isolated farms.

### Military

The kingdom has a well-trained and well-equipped army, composed of both professional soldiers and conscripts from the local population. The army is primarily used to defend against raiders and marauders from the nearby forests and hills, but it is also occasionally called upon to aid neighboring kingdoms in times of war. The queen is guarded by the elite Queensguard, a group of knights sworn to her protection. There are also a number of religious chilvalric orders such as the Knights of St. Haurchefante, a knightly order taking Zio as their example.  

### Trade & Foreign Relations

The kingdom has a thriving trade economy, with merchants traveling across the continent to sell Angonian goods and purchase rare commodities from distant lands. The kingdom is known for its high-quality wool, smoked meats, and beer, as well as its skilled craftsmen who produce fine metalwork and textiles. They currently trade happily with the Gorham Empire and the Hurstlandian League.

### Religion

There is a strong religious tradition in the kingdom, with several temples and shrines dedicated to the Good Three and other deities. Many villages have their own local shrines, and there are several large monasteries and convents where monks and nuns study and practice their faith.
The kingdom is home to several magical schools and academies, which attract students from across the continent. These schools teach a variety of arcane and divine magic, and their graduates often go on to become powerful wizards, sorcerers, or priests.

The kingdom is not without its challenges, however. The nearby Cerridwen's Wood is home to many dangerous creatures, including hostile fey, giant spiders, and evil treants. There are also rumors of powerful dragons emerging from the nearby mountains, and there have been occasional outbreaks of disease and famine. Nevertheless, the people of Angonian are resilient and resourceful, and they remain committed to building a prosperous and peaceful kingdom.

### View on Magic

The Kingdom of Angonia has a somewhat mixed view on magic. While they recognize its usefulness and potential for great power, they also fear its unpredictable and sometimes dangerous nature. Many people in Angonia believe that magic should be closely regulated and controlled, with only trained and licensed mages allowed to practice it. A result of the Fall of the Wevendran Magocracy.

There are also some who view magic as a corrupting force that leads people down dark paths and tempts them with power they cannot control. These individuals often advocate for a complete ban on magic, believing that the risks outweigh any potential benefits.

Despite these concerns, there are still many mages and magic-users in Angonia, and they play an important role in the kingdom's economy and society. Some of them work as healers, using their powers to cure the sick and injured, while others are employed by the military or other organizations as powerful weapons. However, these individuals are often closely monitored and regulated by the government to ensure that their powers are not misused.
