## Halflings

From the PHB:

The comforts of home are the goals of most halflingsâ€™ lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing fire and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation. Though some halflings live out their days in remote agricultural communities, others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples. But even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth, and home, though home might be a wagon jostling along an dirt road or a raft floating downriver.

Still applies here to the halflings of this world. They keep to themselves in small pastoral or farming communities. They love things that grow and good food and drink. 

### Religion

They revere Hrava more prominently than the other gods of the Good Three, but still respect all three. Their shrines are much more modest, they build no giant temples, but instead have small woodland clearings where they worship the Good Three and their allies.

### Magic

Magic holds a similar place among halflings as it does for humans. They are excited by it, but have some skepticism after the Feycerrag War. There are fewer halfling mages than other races as they tend to live in relative isolation and not send halflings off to become trained at schools.
