## Dunwulf

Dunwulf was an important independent trading city on the coast of the Thalimor Sea. Dunwulf is one of the most cosmopolitan cities on the southern coast of the Sea and attracts artisans, artists, scholars, and mages from across the region. Dunwulf was built by the dwarves of the nearby Ashenpeaks with the help of the humans who had settled in the region. In the Old City, all the buildings are built out of massive blocks of stone hauled from the mountains. These buildings are surrounded by a massive wall protecting the Old City and its many denizens. As the city grew, new buildings were erected outside the dwarven walls and the city grew and grew. 

### Government 

Dunwulf was ruled by a council of three politicians who run for office in a direct democracy. Law & order was kept by the City Watch. 

### Religion

Dunwulf was home to the largest cathedral to the Good Three in the region as well as a number of monastic orders devoted to each of the Good Three and their kin.
