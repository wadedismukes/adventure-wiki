# Inner Planes

The inner planes comprise the planes in which the mortal races live. 

## Creation 

After the creation of the Outer Planes, Auriel and Tharizdun used their new planes to create new kinds of creatures to further their Eternal Struggle of Good and Evil. The first of these were the 6 deities ruling the three Upper Planes and the three Lower Planes. 

The rulers of the Upper Planes:

Celestia (LG) - Zio the Blind. Zio was the encapsulation of justice, the brave, honor, and honesty. Zio is known to never break a promise, and despises treachery most of all. 

Arborea (CG) - Olia the Maker. Olia was the encapsulation of creativity, she was a master of all crafts. She was responsible for crafting the vessel that contains the Material World and its echoes. She created the dwarves and set them to wake when the Material World was ready. 

Elysium (NG) - Hrava the Planter. Hrava set forth the evolution of life on the Material Plane and its echoes. He represents the good harvest, the warm hearth and welcoming home, and the goodness of life.


The rulers of the Lower Planes:

The Nine Hells of Baator (LE) - Asmodeus the Deceiver. It's the devil guys. 

The Bleak Eternity of Gehenna (NE) - Loviator the Lady of Plagues. She is responsible for decay, rot and disease. The complete opposite of Hrava, she represents the rotten fruit on the vine, the biting cold of winter, and pain. 

The Abyss (CE) - Lolth the Devourer. The Queen of Spiders. Represents violence, savagery. She has a never ending hunger for all things good. She devours all of them.

Olia had spent eons in Arborea crafting the vessel that would contain a place for mortal beings to live from the elements in the Elemental Chaos. Once complete the Good Three placed the vessel at the center of all things. Within this vessel Hrava planted the first seed of life, noticing that the sun of the Plane of Fire laid far away lighting this world during the day and at night two moons reflected this light from the elemental plane of Earth. Zio carried water from the Plane of Water and filled the oceans and lakes. Olia crafted mountains and hills and carved caverns into the vessel. Within these caverns Olia placed her finest creation, the dwarfs. All the while Hrava tended the life she created for this new world. 

Eventually, the Good Three returned to their homes knowing their creation would take time. While there more gods were bore from their thoughts, their love, and their craft. These are detailed in the deities section, here we only mention the relevant deities for the creation of the Inner Planes. Olia and Zio had twins, Titania and Mab, the first of the Fey creatures, they delighted in mischief, art, and nature. They made their way to the Material Plane and delighted in its new life using their magic to create new beings from their mother's original plan. From their magic the Fey races were born. And together they transformed the material plane into a world of beauty, of growing things, and magic. Titania delighted in the music of her mother's creations: babbling brooks and singing birds. Mab savored the hunt gathering her best to form the Wild Hunt. 

Sensing this magic, the Evil Three came to investigate this new plane and found numerous species to tempt or mutate into twisted forms. These evil creatures fought with Titania and Mab's creations endlessly. The twins called on their parents to strike the Evil Three from the land and in doing so the material plane was magically split into the Prime Material Plane and two echo planes, the Feywild where Titania, Mab and their creations could live peacefully. The other echo plane was a corrupted area of darkness called the Shadowfell. Unbeknownst to the any of the good creatures, the Evil Three had placed eggs of their own creations, the dragons, within the Prime Material Plane. 

## The Prime Material Plane

The homeplane of Orcs, Humans, Dwarves, Dragonkin, and Halflings. This is the plane that is analogous to our own Earth except with fantasy races.

## The Feywild

The land of Faerie. This is the homeplane of the feyraces: elves, gnomes, goblinoids, centaurs, satyrs, dryads, minotaurs, fairies, hexbloods, harengon, owlin, etc. This is a mirror to the Prime Material Plane but a wild mirror full of growing things and constant twilight.

## The Shadowfell

The land of Shadow. It's the Upside-Down from Stranger Things.
