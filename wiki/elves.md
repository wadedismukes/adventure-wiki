## Elves

When Titania and Mab arrived on the Material Plane they encountered primate-like beings that they magically awoke and transmuted creating the first elves (these were the Eladrin). From the Eladrin all manner of elf descended: wood elves, dawn elves, dusk elves, and the shadar-kai. The first three of these were original to the Feywild, the Shadar-Kai were the elves that when the Material Plane shattered into its echeos these were the elves left in the Shadowfell. The wood elves are the elves that did not return to the Feywild after the Shattering. They love all things that grow and love to hunt and forage. They stay hidden from the world in small groups and have no true cities. The dawn and dusk elves did return and represent elves who enjoy either the sun or the two moons and the stars. Dusk elves use the drow stats. 

### Magic

Elves are born of magic and naturally take to it. They have some of the most gifted mages on the Prime Material Plane. They founded a school of magic in Cerridwen's Wood where any can go to learn (but they are highly skeptical of human students).

### Religion

Elves worship The Good Three and their creators Titania and/or Mab. Depending on who their families (or they) sided with during the Feycerrag war they revere usually Titania or Mab over the other. This is a matter of pride. They also have a number of fae they revere as saints who were slain in this war.
