## Dwarfs 

Dwarfs were created by Olia the Crafter. She formed them in three ways giving rise to three different types of dwarfs. One group she formed from metal and clay before transmuting them, these were the mountain dwarfs. One group she formed from stone, the duergar. She placed these the deepest in the Material Plane. The final group she brewed using plants from Hrava's garden. These were the hill or brew dwarfs.

Dwarfs in this world are much the same as those in others. They procreate by crafting new dwarfs together usally, but not always, in pairs. This is a highly ritualistic and sacred process whose secrets are heavily guarded by dwarfkind. This can only be done in three dwarf homes blessed by Olia herself. 

### Religion

They have a religous level respect for crafts and their priests are themselves crafters. Much of their religion is devoted to Olia who they revere as the Dwarfmother. This religion is more monotheistic than the worship practiced by the other species whose homeplane is the Prime Material whose worship of the Good Three resembles something closer to polytheism where churches have altars to all three and then some of their offspring as well. 

### Magic

Dwarfs use magic, but they are more interested in its use enhancing existing crafted objects. Thus they are more likely to be Abjurers or Transmuters than anything else. 

### History

There have been numerous dwarfholds that have been lost fighting dragons, their sworn enemies. Many were also lost in the Feycerrag War. This has led to some amount of distrust between dwarfs and other races. They tend to have a softspot for gnomes who share their love of crafting. They really do not care for dragonborn though, and will be deeply skeptical of working alongside them until their actions prove otherwise.
