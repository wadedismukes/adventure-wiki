## Goblinoids

The Goblins of the Feywild are the creations of Mab. She created these creatures from species ancestral to the Orcs, and they became her favored children. The goblins were excellent hunters of prey larger than themselves. They were composed of three kinds: goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears. These creatures nearly all served the Unseelie Court during the War of the Feycerrag. Today they roam the Material Plane pursuing their own destinies. Some live in the Fey Kingdoms of the Prime Material Plane, others make their own in the metropolitan cities of the Thalimor Sea. Despite their difference in appearance, goblinoids are somewhat monoculture. In the Feywild they had a strict caste system with Hobgoblins at the top, bugbears below them, and goblins at the bottom. 

### Magic

Goblins love magic and are some of the most common fey wizards primarily due to their numbers. There are just a lot more goblins than elves and other less common fey. 

### Religion

Goblins worship Mab as well as the Good Three generally.
